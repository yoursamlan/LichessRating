# LichessRating

Since I am the admin of Bengali Chess Group on quora, I have to look after everyone's rating on lichess to publish monthly rating list. Now, as I am the biggest procrastinator you have ever known, I have automated entire list using python. For this project I have implemented web scrapping using BeautifulSoup. The features of the rating list is as following...

1. It will generate Rating list of top 5 player in Bullet, Blitz, Rapid and Classical Format
2. It will ignore all provisional rating.
