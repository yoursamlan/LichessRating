# LichessRating

Being the admin of [♔♛ সাদা কালো মগজাস্ত্র](https://bn.quora.com/q/daba) , a Bengali chess group on quora, I have to look after everyone's rating on lichess to publish monthly rating list. Now, since, I am the biggest procrastinator you have ever known, I have automated entire list using python. For this project I have implemented web scrapping using BeautifulSoup. The features of the rating list is as following...

1. It will generate Rating list of top 5 player in Bullet, Blitz, Rapid and Classical Format
2. It will ignore all provisional rating.
